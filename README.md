# mvc
Note:
The solution has four projects: Data, Service, Web and unit tests. The solution was created using Visual Studio 2017.

This application has attached sql databases. "HR" is for the main web applicagtion and "UnitTestHR" is for the unit test section. Daytabase queries are handled by Entity Framework. 

When the applcation starts up, it will display the main page which includes an MVC grid. Some sample employees exist in the system.
Above the grid there is a link to add an employee and subsequent dependents. When a new amployee is saved, the user will be taken to the 
details page view which will show some costs calculations. To go home, simply click the home link in the menu bar. Saved employees can 
be viewed and deleted from the main page, grid row links.

There is a unit test project with three unit tests which can be run as well. Thanks!
